# Egghead
Egghead is an metaphorically-accurate experimental mind simulator with two main goals:
* Provide an application upon which to demonstrate object oriented refactoring techniques
* Provide a platform for gaining insight into how our minds operate, allowing us to experiment with alterations both to the application and our real mind.

Egghead demonstrates the refactoring of a rigid, inflexible, hard to understand system into one that can be understood and changed in many ways to suit various needs. Refactorings and good object oriented design lead to greater and greater insights as previously hidden concepts operating in our minds are reified into easy to understand objects.

The mind is a busy, chaotic place and egghead is no different.

This project is stil in [hammock mode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) so things are quite a mess, but expect more soon.

The `goal` branch has ideas on the end state, and the `start` branch has ideas on the "original" state of the application. Eventually `master` will be the start of a path from the "original" state towards the "goal" state of the application.
